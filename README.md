# 0th-order floquet

With a tight-binding model based on wannier_hr.dat from Wannier90 package, we implemented 0th-order floquet calculations for both floquet band structure and (projected) density of states. 

## Inputs preparation
One need to untar k-grid_files.tar to have the folder named k-grid_files. Also one need to prepare a folder named "wannier_files" that contains wannier.win, wannier.wout, wannier_hr.dat, wannier_band.kpt, wannier_band.gnu.
